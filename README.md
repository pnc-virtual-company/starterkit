# Laravel starter kit

This starter will help you to start your first laravel project without the need to download or install something. Copy/paste the distribution and start to develop in PHP.

We don't rely on npm for installing the 3rd party libraries:

* Meterial Design icons
* JQuery
* PopperJS
* Bootstrap 4

This starter kit doesn't require you to setup a virtual host. It can works from the public subfolder directly.
